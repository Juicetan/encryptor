![appicon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93d15ef-7c71-4345-bb68-6dda38f2a322)

An end to end encrypted peer to peer communication tool implemented with WebRTC.

This tool uses client side encryption/decryption that facilitates a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between two clients via WebRTC.

Alternatively you can use it to manually facilitate key exchange and payload encryption to be transmitted through other channels.
